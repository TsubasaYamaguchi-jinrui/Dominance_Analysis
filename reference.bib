  abstract = "In the analysis of social dominance in groups of animals,
              linearity has been used by many researchers as the main
              structural characteristic of a dominance hierarchy. In this paper
              we propose, alongside linearity, a quantitative measure for
              another property of a dominance hierarchy, namely its steepness.
              Steepness of a hierarchy is defined here as the absolute slope of
              the straight line fitted to the normalized David's scores
              (calculated on the basis of a dyadic dominance index corrected
              for chance) plotted against the subjects' ranks. This correction
              for chance is an improvement of an earlier proposal by de Vries
              (appendix 2 in de Vries, Animal Behaviour, 1998, 55, 827-843). In
              addition, we present a randomization procedure for determining
              the statistical significance of a hierarchy's steepness, which
              can be used to test the observed steepness against the steepness
              expected under the null hypothesis of random win chances for all
              pairs of individuals. Whereas linearity depends on the number of
              established binary dominance relationships and the degree of
              transitivity in these relationships, steepness measures the
              degree to which individuals differ from each other in winning
              dominance encounters. Linearity and steepness are complementary
              measures to characterize a dominance hierarchy. \copyright{} 2006

  abstract  = "Appleby (1983, Anim. Behav., 31, 600--608) described a
               statistical test, based on the work of Kendall (1962, Rank
               Correlation Methods), for the significance of linearity in
               dominance hierarchies. He suggested that unknown relationships
               should be assigned the value 12 and that subsequently the same
               test procedure can be used. In this paper it is shown that
               incorrect results are obtained by this method whenever there are
               unknown relationships. Values of the linearity index are
               systematically too low. P-values can be too high
               (underestimating the significance) or too low (overestimating),
               and seem to differ by not much more than a factor two
               (respectively a half) from the correct P-value. An improved
               method is developed for testing linearity in a set of dominance
               relationships containing unknown relationships. Furthermore, it
               is argued that, if one admits the possibility of tied dominance
               relationships, which should indeed be assigned the value 12,
               Landau's linearity index is to be preferred to Kendall's index.
               A randomization test is developed for assessing the significance
               of linearity or non-linearity in a set of dominance
               relationships containing unknown or tied relationships. The test
               statistic employed in this testing procedure is based on
               Landau's linearity index, but takes the unknown and tied
               relationships into account.",

               social traits are inherent species characteristics that depend
               largely on phylogenetic histories of species rather than on
               adaptation to current socioecological conditions. These models
               predict that aspects of social structure will vary more between
               species than within species and that they will display strong
               phylogenetic signals. We tested these predictions in macaques
               focusing on dominance gradients, a relatively little studied,
               yet central, aspect of social structure. We used data from 14
               social groups representing nine macaque species living in a
               variety of conditions. We examined proportions of
               counteraggression and two recently developed measures of
               dominance gradients (hierarchical steepness) for phylogenetic
               signals in nine phylogenetic trees constructed using (1)
               available genetic data sets and (2) Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
               Carlo (MCMC) and maximum likelihood algorithms. Hierarchical
               steepness and counteraggression showed significant variation
               between species but inconsistent variation within species. Both
               steepness and counteraggression showed evidence of phylogenetic
               signals, with results being particularly strong for one
               steepness measure and for counteraggression. Our results suggest
               that between-species variation in some core aspects of social
               structure are shaped by species' evolutionary relationships,
               despite differences in living conditions. As such, they provide
               broad support for the phylogenetic model. \copyright{} 2012 The

  abstract  = "A procedure for ordering a set of individuals into a linear or
               near-linear dominance hierarchy is presented. Two criteria are
               used in a prioritized way in reorganizing the dominance matrix
               to find an order that is most consistent with a linear
               hierarchy: first, minimization of the numbers of inconsistencies
               and, second, minimization of the total strength of the
               inconsistencies. The linear ordering procedure, which involves
               an iterative algorithm based on a generalized swapping rule, is
               feasible for matrices of up to 80 individuals. The procedure can
               be applied to any dominance matrix, since it does not make any
               assumptions about the form of the probabilities of winning and
               losing. The only assumption is the existence of a linear or

               linearity test. A review of existing ranking methods is
               presented and these are compared with the proposed method.

  title     = "A social network perspective on measurements of dominance

  author    = "Shizuka, Daizaburo and McDonald, David B",
  abstract  = "The hierarchical organization of dominance relations among
               animals has wide-ranging implications in social evolution. The
               structure of dominance relations has often been measured using
               indices of linearity (e.g. Landau's h, Kendall's K): the degree
               to which dominance relations adhere to a linear hierarchy. An
               alternative measure is the transitivity of dominance relations
               among sets of three players that all interact with each other, a
               measure we call triangle transitivity (ttri). Triangle
               transitivity and linearity are essentially equivalent when
               dominance relations of all dyads are known, but such complete
               observations are rare in empirical studies. Triangle
               transitivity has two major advantages: it does not require
               `filling in' of unobserved relations, and its expected value is
               constant across group sizes. We use a social network perspective
               to demonstrate a property of transitivity in random directed
               networks (on average, three-fourths of complete triads are
               transitive) and show that empirical dominance networks are often
               significantly more transitive than random networks. Using 101
               published dominance matrices we show that published algorithms
               for assessing linearity underestimate the level of social
               orderliness, particularly in larger groups, which tend to have
               more null dyads. Thus, previous puzzlement over the decrease in
               estimated linearity in larger groups could be due largely to the
               bias introduced by random filling of null dyads. We argue that
               triangle transitivity will allow researchers to focus on
               important processes underlying the dynamics of dominance, such
               as spatial segregation, avoidance of interactions by certain
               individuals and detailed temporal patterns in the ontogeny of
               hierarchy formation.",
